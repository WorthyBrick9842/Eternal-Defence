Hello!
This is my first github repository so if anything doesnt work or should be done differently let me know.
for this to run you will need pygame installed on your device, and run main.py to run the game.
When running the game feel free to edit the entity stats in statsMap as currently defences are slightly overpowered

Current issues:
defence not being attacked
Too many entities making the game laggy (pathfinding all happens at once and needs to be staggered)
